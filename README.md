# paper-vault
An Obsidian vault for paper notes, literature indexes, and AI-assisted research workflows.

Implemented workflows:

- `paper-discover`: search, verify, deduplicate, and rank papers from user
  requirements or explicitly named Markdown briefs.
- `paper-ingest`: turn a selected paper into a canonical note and update
  indexes.
- `paper-intake`: run one configuration-driven recurring intake cycle by
  composing `paper-discover` and `paper-ingest`, while retaining candidate
  history, balancing coverage across recent runs, keeping each run internally
  coherent, and leaving all generated notes uncommitted.

Recurring intake configuration:

- `paper-intake-config-example.md`: version-controlled example for researchers.
- `paper-intake-config.md`: ignored local preferences and per-run settings.

Create the local configuration with:

```sh
cp paper-intake-config-example.md paper-intake-config.md
```

A scheduler only decides when to invoke `paper-intake`; the skill owns one run's
workflow. For example:

```text
Use $paper-intake with paper-intake-config.md to run one intake cycle in this
repository. Leave all generated files unstaged and uncommitted.
```

The scheduler itself is intentionally not stored or managed by this repository.

When the intake configuration names an external PDF destination,
`paper-intake` uses the verified PDF as its ingestion source and delivers a copy
outside the vault. Unattended schedulers need scoped write permission to that
destination. PDFs and machine-specific local paths are never added to the
repository.
