  - Title: JENGA: Enhancing LLM Long-Context Fine-tuning with Contextual Token Sparsity
  - Role in paper: Selection stage between pattern prediction and sparsity-aware execution.
  - Mechanism: Applies informativeness scores and layer thresholds to remove low-utility token blocks from expensive operations.
  - Why listed here: Translates predicted sparsity into concrete activation-memory and computation savings.
